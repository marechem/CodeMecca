Problem Statement and Introduction : To help users make the best decisions in 
deciding which medications will provide patients with the best effects based on 
the individual patient's inputs.  The drugs suggested serve as a guide to let the 
patient be more informed and better prepared to speak with a doctor about the concerns 
that they have.

Test Case
User inputs: 
Age, if over 21, user inputs amount they drink
Sex, if female, ask for pregnancy status
Symptom being experienced
Level of pain being experienced
 
he outputs will include :
Opening warning about the proper use of the program
Final result of amount of medication to take, medication name, dosage, and max amount per day.

Conclusion and Limitations: 
If used as part of the research people commonly do when they are about to 
visit a doctor for a given condition, this program will be able to give the user a
quick result that they can discuss with their doctor. Of course,  this program is limited 
by the amount of medication and the information about the medication that is initially loaded in.
However, this limitation can of course easily be minimized by adding more medication data.
